# Tardigrade

### What is Tardigrade?
Tardigrade is hobby project of mine. It is intended to be a sort of conglomerant of languages that I have used, taking the parts I enjoy and leaving behind the parts I don't care for. This does and will not try to be like C, being super performant and low level. Nor does it try to be like Rust, with it's type safety and incredibly tedious and inefficient borrow-checker. There WILL be runtime errors. Sorry "I need everything provably safe" developers. This also does not try to be ultra-high level either. The bytecode behind it is low level and does not have many high-level features, built-in function calls.

### TODO:
- Preprocessor
- Virtual Machine
- Token-to-bytecode Compiler

### Planned/Upcoming features:
- Basic OOP through the use of Types and Type implementations
- Functional programming through the use of expression-line codeblocks and lambda functions
